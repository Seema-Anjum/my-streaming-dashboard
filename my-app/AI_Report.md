### 🔧 1. Areas Where AI Was Used

# a. Debugging & Error Diagnosis #

AI was used to help debug:

Next.js server-side rendering issues

AbortError: This operation was aborted from TMDB API

Network-level ETIMEDOUT errors

Image domain configuration warnings

404 API route mistakes in the App Router

AI explained root causes and helped generate fixes, which were then applied manually.

# b. Performance / Best Practices

AI suggested:

Using no-store cache for API SSR

Using remotePatterns for TMDB images

Simplifying loading states

Separating client/server components

Improving fetch safety & fallback handling  

### 🧠 2. What Was Done Independently ###

The following were fully implemented and reasoned independently:

TMDB API key setup

Environment configuration

Actual component integration

Creating API routes in /app/api/...

Styling and UI adjustments

Managing state with hooks

Debugging and testing network-level issues

Understanding and resolving build errors

AI did not write the project; it assisted in accelerating development and clarifying issues.

### 📑 3. How AI Code Was Validated

Every AI-generated snippet went through:

TypeScript validation

Local testing

API response verification

Performance testing in browser and Node.js


### 🚀 4. Final Summary

AI was used as a support tool, not as an automatic generator.
Its role was mainly:

Debug assistant

Documentation helper

Performance advisor

Idea generator

Code reviewer

The full implementation, architecture decisions, debugging, and testing were done manually.

This ensures the project remains my own work, with AI helping only to speed up and improve code quality.
